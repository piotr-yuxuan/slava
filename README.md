# What does it do?

It provides facilities for converting Avro data between several
representations:

- Instance of `org.apache.avro.specific.SpecificRecord`;
- Instance of `org.apache.avro.specific.GenericRecord`;
- Clojure map with `:avro.schema/name` key;

To fulfill this goal it comes with wrappers around
 `io.confluent.kafka.streams.serdes.avro.SpecificAvroSerde` and
 `io.confluent.kafka.streams.serdes.avro.GenericAvroSerde`
 schema-registry compatible Avro implementations of
 `org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.Serde<T>`. It also provides
 ancillary functions to use in Clojure code.

# What can I use it for?

General avro data handling. Allows simpler Kafka Streams Clojure code.

This poster reads: ¬´ Glory to Soviet People, creator of a powerful
aviation ¬ª. Created in 1954 year it is a perfect symbol of the
powerful soviet militarism stream of that time.

Avro was a British aircraft manufacturer, but as the propaganda goes,
_Soviet aircrafts are the best aircrafts_.
