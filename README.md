This poster reads: ¬´ Glory to Soviet People, creator of a powerful
aviation ¬ª. Created in 1954 year it is a perfect symbol of the
powerful soviet militarism stream of that time. Avro was a British
aircraft manufacturer, but as the propaganda goes, _Soviet aircrafts
are the best aircrafts_.

# What does it aim at?

Present Kafka messages as primitive map-like data structures, which
are more friendly than Avro specific / generic record objects. Achieve
it by providing a custom Avro Kafka Serde heavily relying on upstream
Avro and Confluent code.

- Implement a custom `org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.Serde`
- Works on the JVM, useful for Clojure or any other language
- Rely as much as possible on upstream Avro and Confluent codes
- Well-integrated with Confluent schema registry

# Test example with Kafka Streams

``` clojure
```
